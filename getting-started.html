<h2>Getting Started</h2>
The Volume Controller App needs to run on both your PC and your phone. So, download the app on both
platforms.
<h3>Windows</h3>
The Windows program is located

After running Volume Controller.exe, Microsoft Defender
SmartScreen may not recognize the app. This app is brand new and has not been "downloaded by many Windows
users" yet.
